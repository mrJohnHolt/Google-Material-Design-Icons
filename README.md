Fork of Google Material Icons

Material Icons from Google are a great way to enhance you DaVinci Resolve Fusion Macros. Using a "Loader" node allows you to bring in any of the Google Material Icons .png files into your Macro.

The link to the Google Icon website is. https://fonts.google.com/icons

However I have created a fork from Google's GitHub Repository to my own allowing Fusion users easy access to PNG and SVG Material Icons.
